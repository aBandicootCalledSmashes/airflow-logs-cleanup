## Overview

Managing log files in Apache Airflow can become a challenge as the number of logs grows over time. The **Airflow Logs Cleanup** project provides a solution to clean up old log files, freeing up valuable disk space. You can use a script or an Airflow DAG to automate the cleanup process. This tool will help you delete rotated logs, remove old files, and clean up empty directories, ensuring your Airflow environment runs smoothly.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/airflow-logs-cleanup.git
cd airflow-logs-cleanup
```

Next, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/aBandicootCalledSmashes/airflow-logs-cleanup/releases). Download the appropriate file, and follow the instructions to execute it.

## Usage

### Running the Script

You can run the cleanup script directly from the command line:

```bash
python cleanup.py
```

### Setting Up the Airflow DAG

To use the cleanup functionality within Airflow, you can set up a DAG. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
from cleanup import clean_logs

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1,
}

dag = DAG('airflow_logs_cleanup', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily')

cleanup_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='cleanup_logs',
    python_callable=clean_logs,
    dag=dag,
)

cleanup_task
```

### Configuration

You can customize the cleanup process by modifying the configuration file. Hereâ€™s a sample configuration:

```json
{
    "log_directory": "/path/to/airflow/logs",
    "retention_days": 30,
    "delete_empty_dirs": true
}
```
